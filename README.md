<h1>Data Mining - Predicting patients at risk of diabetes </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Predicting diabetic patient from non-diabetic patient using gradient boosted models(xgboost, catboost, so forth), multi-layer perceptron with TensorFlow and SK-learn libraries. The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset contains healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey information about people in general along with their diagnosis of diabetes. The 35 features consist of some demographics, lab test results, and answers to survey questions for each patient. The target variable for classification is whether a patient has diabetes or is pre-diabetic (1), or healthy (0).
